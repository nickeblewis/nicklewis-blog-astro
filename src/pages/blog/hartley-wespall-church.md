This Church is set in beautiful countryside, nestled in between a farmhouse and it's outbuildings. It is surrounded by a flint wall and the building itself is constructed from the same materials. It dates back to 1286 however it is believed that the oldest parts of the church date from around 1330. It was later mostly rebuilt in 1868.

As you approach the front of the church via it's porch, you are greeted by these stunning stained-glass decorative window panes, they are so beautiful, especially with the morning light shining!
