I have no idea where this was taken, I simply cannot remember. I reckon it was local. I believe it to be one of the bridges that spans our local canal, the Basingstoke Canal. I found it whilst going through Cloudinary. In fact I'd say it's one of those shots that I archived and never used for anything in the past but now it's baffled me - maybe you know where it is? How is your random canal bridge knowledge?!!
